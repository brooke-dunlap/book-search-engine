## Description

The Book Search Engine app involves transforming a Google Books API search engine, initially built with a RESTful API, into a GraphQL API using Apollo Server. The application supports user authentication and allows users to save and manage book searches. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Users can discover new books by typing in the title, or part of the title, of a book. Additionally, users can sign up for an account and login to their existing account. Once logged in, users can "Save" books they discover. All their saved books will be listed within the "See Your Books" page on the nav bar. From there, users are able to remove any books they no longer wish to save. Lastly, users can logout of their account.
